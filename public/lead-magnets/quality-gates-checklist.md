# N3wth Orchestrator Lead Magnet: Agent Quality Gates Checklist

**The exact quality gates we use to ensure AI agents ship production code.**

## What's Included

- Pre-execution checklist
- Code quality gates (TypeScript, linting, tests)
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning requirements
- Memory and context management templates
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## How to Use

1. Implement each quality gate
2. Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline
3. Track agent success rate
4. Iterate based on failures

## Inside the Checklist

- Compilation checks
- Type safety requirements (>80% coverage)
- Performance gates (bundle size, latency)
- Security scanning (vulnerabilities, dependency audits)
- Testing standards (unit, integration, edge cases)
- Monitoring setup (cost tracking, latency, success rates)
