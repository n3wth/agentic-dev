            "text": "AI agent development involves building autonomous systems powered by large language models (like Claude) that can perform tasks independently, make decisions, and execute code without constant human supervision. These agents use orchestration patterns, quality gates, and feedback loops to deliver production-ready code."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Through proper orchestration, context grounding, quality gates, and feedback loops. We use a proven framework of specialized agents (architect, implementer, reviewer, tester) that work together with human oversight to ship high-quality code at scale. The n3wth-orchestrator framework has delivered 360x faster component sync and 92% first-pass approval rates."

Claude coding agents are a powerful example of agentic AI that can write, review, test, and deploy code with minimal human intervention."

For example, one agent might scan GitHub issues, another generates fixes, a third reviews the code, and a fourth handles testing and deployment. This division of labor enables autonomous systems that can ship production code 24/7."
