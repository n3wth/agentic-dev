## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide for Autonomous Agents

### Phase 1: Shadow Mode (Weeks 1-2)

Agent recommends actions. Human approves all before execution.

**Weekly Goals:**
- Week 1: Test agent on 100 real scenarios. Hit 80% accuracy?
- Week 2: Agent refines based on feedback. Ready for limited scope?

**Success Metrics:**
- Accuracy: >80%
- Customer satisfaction with recommendations: >4.0/5.0
- Agent speed: <2 minutes per decision

### Phase 2: Limited Scope (Weeks 3-4)

Agent handles 25% of volume autonomously. Humans handle rest.

**Constraints:**
- Only easy/routine cases (define clearly)
- Escalate immediately if uncertain
- Monitor closely

**Daily Checks:**
- Resolution rate: Target >75%
- Escalation rate: Target <20%
- Customer satisfaction: Target >4.0/5.0

### Phase 3: Expanded Scope (Weeks 5-6)

Agent handles 60% of volume autonomously.

**Expanded Authority:**
- More complex cases
- Higher decision limits (if applicable)
- More tools/capabilities

**Daily Checks:**
- Same metrics as Phase 2
- Watch for error patterns
- Retrain if needed

### Phase 4: Full Production (Week 7+)

Agent handles 100% of volume. Humans monitor.

**Ongoing Management:**
- Daily metrics review (30 min)
- Weekly pattern analysis (1 hour)
- Monthly retraining (if needed)
- Quarterly deep dives
