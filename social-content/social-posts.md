## Stat-Based Posts

### Post 1: Adoption Gap
"80% of support tickets are routine. But teams still answer them manually. That's not a product problem. That's a *deployment* problem. Autonomous agents can handle these in 1 minute vs. 8 hours. [Read how](#)"

### Post 2: ROI Metrics
"Support agent ROI: Cost per ticket drops from $45 to $3. Multiply that by 2,000 tickets/week. That's $4.2M/year in savings. Plus 24/7 availability. Plus happier team. [Case study here](#)"

### Post 3: Hiring Advantage
"The fastest-hiring companies use agents. They screen resumes in hours instead of days. Result: Better candidates accept offers. 14-day hiring cycle beats 35-day hiring cycle. [How to build one](#)"

### Post 4: Agents Aren't Magic
"Every PM thinks their problem can be solved by an agent. It can't. Agents work for routine, deterministic tasks. They're terrible at nuance. 60% of problems need humans. Build agents for the 40%, not everything."

### Post 5: Start Simple
"Your instinct: Build a sophisticated multi-agent system. Better instinct: Build a single agent that handles one task exceptionally well. Master simple before adding complexity. Most agent failures are over-engineering from day 1."

### Post 6: Human-Agent Systems Win
"The winning approach isn't full automation. It's human-agent teaming. Agent handles routine, escalates complex. Human handles complex, coaches agent. This combination beats both humans alone and agents alone."

### Post 7: SupportFlow Story
"Support team was drowning: 2,000 tickets/week, 8-hour response time, 40% wanted to leave. We built an agent. 80% of tickets now resolved in 1 minute. Team morale went through the roof. Not because of less work. Because they moved to meaningful work."

### Post 8: The Discovery Call
"Client said: 'We need an AI agent for everything.' After analyzing their processes: 'You need an agent for 3 of 47 tasks. The other 44 need better process, not automation.' We killed the agent plan. They implemented process improvements instead. Saved them $500K in consulting."

## Question-Based Posts

### Post 9: Engagement Hook
"What's one task in your business that's:
1. Routine (same process every time)
2. High volume (100+ per week)
3. Low-value (doesn't require expertise)

That's where your first agent should go. What comes to mind?"

### Post 10: Poll/Research
"How confident are you that you could deploy an agent in your company today?
- Very confident (we have the skills)
- Somewhat confident (we'd figure it out)
- Not confident (no idea where to start)

Reply. I'll send resources based on what people say."
