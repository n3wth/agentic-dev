**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
I just built a consulting site that actually converts 🚀

No fancy framework. No bloat. Just HTML + Cal.com + FormSubmit.

360x cost improvement proof points → Cal.com booking → Revenue.

Live in production: agentic-dev-rho.vercel.app

Here's how I did it 👇
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
Most consulting sites are terrible:
• Vague services
• No social proof  
• "Contact us" forms that go nowhere
• No clear pricing
• Takes weeks to build

I needed something that SHIPS CODE and BOOKS CALLS.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
The stack:
• Static HTML (fast AF)
• FormSubmit.co (free form backend)
• Cal.com (instant booking)
• Vercel (deploy in 10 seconds)
• Zero backend, zero maintenance

Total setup time: 2 hours
Total cost: $0/month
```

**Tweet 4 (Proof):**
```
Real results from n3wth-orchestrator:
• 360x cost improvement
• $0.59 for 11 parallel PRs
• Production-tested on real code

Not a demo. Not a toy. Actual engineering infrastructure.

This is what I'm selling consulting for.
```

**Tweet 5 (CTA):**
```
If you're building AI agent systems and need:
• Multi-agent orchestration
• MCP integration
• Production infrastructure

Book a call: [your Cal.com link]

$200/hr or fixed-price projects.

Let's ship something real 🚢

## LinkedIn Post

**Title:** Launching AI Agent Orchestration Consulting

**Body:**
```
After building n3wth-orchestrator (360x cost improvement, $0.59 for 11 PRs), 
I'm now offering consulting for teams that want production-grade agent systems.

🎯 What I help with:
• Multi-agent workflow design
• MCP integration and tool development
• Cost optimization (real results, not promises)
• Production deployment and monitoring

💡 Why now?
Most "agent frameworks" are demos. Few ship to production. I've built infrastructure 
that coordinates 11 parallel agents, handles real code review, and actually works.

### r/MachineLearning (Careful - they hate self-promotion)
**Title:** [D] Production AI Agent Orchestration: Lessons from 360x Cost Improvement

**Body:**
```
I built n3wth-orchestrator to coordinate multiple AI agents for code review at scale. 
Some interesting findings:

• 360x cost improvement vs naive approaches
• $0.59 to orchestrate 11 parallel PRs
• Key insight: Most of the cost is in poor orchestration, not the LLM calls

Technical details:
- Task decomposition is critical
- Stateful coordination > stateless parallel calls
- Retry logic needs exponential backoff + circuit breakers
- MCP provides clean tool interfaces

Happy to discuss the architecture. Not selling anything, just sharing what worked.

### r/LangChain
**Title:** Built a production agent orchestrator - 360x cost improvement

**Body:**
```
After struggling with LangChain/LangGraph for multi-agent systems, I built 
n3wth-orchestrator with these principles:

1. Explicit state management
2. Clean task decomposition  
3. Proper error handling (not just try/catch)
4. Cost tracking at every step

Results: $0.59 for 11 parallel PR reviews vs $212 naive approach.

### IndieHackers
**Title:** Launched AI consulting site using only free tools ($0 MRR → ? MRR)

**Body:**
```
Built a consulting landing page in 2 hours using:
• Static HTML (no React, no framework bloat)
• FormSubmit.co (free form backend)
• Cal.com (free booking)
• Vercel (free hosting)

Total cost: $0/month
Time to first deploy: 10 minutes

The key: Focus on conversion, not features.
- Real proof points (360x cost improvement)
- Clear pricing ($200/hr)
- Direct booking (no "schedule a call with my assistant")
- One-page site (everything visible, no navigation)

Now testing if technical consulting can work with a productized approach.

## HackerNews

**Title:** Show HN: AI Agent Orchestration Consulting (360x cost improvement)

**Body:**
```
I built n3wth-orchestrator after spending $212 on a naive multi-agent approach 
that could have cost $0.59 with proper orchestration.

Now offering consulting for teams building production agent systems:
• Multi-agent workflow design
• MCP integration
• Cost optimization
• Production infrastructure

Tech stack: Claude/GPT-4o, Anthropic MCP, LangGraph, Docker, Railway

Real results, not demos. Happy to answer technical questions.

**Subject:** AI Agent Infrastructure for [Company Name]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is building [mention their AI product/feature]. 
I recently built n3wth-orchestrator, which coordinates multiple AI agents 
for production workflows.

Some results:
• 360x cost improvement over naive approaches
• $0.59 to orchestrate 11 parallel PRs
• Production-tested error handling

I'm now offering consulting for teams building agent systems. 
Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss your architecture?

No obligation - happy to share what worked/didn't work for us.

Best,
Oliver
