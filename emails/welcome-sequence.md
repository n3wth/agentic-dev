Subject: Your Agent Quality Gates Checklist is ready

Body:

Hi [Name],

Thanks for downloading the Agent Quality Gates Checklist. Inside you'll find:

✓ Pre-execution checklist
✓ Code quality gates  
✓ Performance benchmarks
✓ Security scanning requirements
✓ Monitoring setup guide
✓ Failure recovery patterns

Get it here: [DOWNLOAD LINK]

50+ teams use this checklist. Most see:
- 60% fewer production issues
- 40% cost reduction
- Better team confidence

One tip: Start with the "no code ships without tests" gate. That alone catches 80% of hallucinations.

# Email Sequence 2: Framework Story (Day 3)

Subject: Why your AI agents keep failing

Body:

Hi [Name],

I consult with a lot of teams building AI agents. They all report the same problem:

❌ Agents hallucinate
❌ Context windows exceeded  
❌ Costs explode
❌ Quality is inconsistent
❌ Deployments fail

The problem isn't the model. It's the system.

Most teams just point agents at their codebase and say "write code." Then they're shocked when it fails.

Here's what actually works:

✅ Proper context grounding
✅ Orchestration system (architect → implementer → reviewer → tester)
✅ Quality gates (tests, types, security, performance)
✅ Memory/state management
✅ Error recovery

This framework fixes 90% of the issues.

# Email Sequence 3: Implementation Guide (Day 7)

Subject: Getting started with agent quality gates

Body:

Hi [Name],

So you've downloaded the checklist. Maybe wondering: "How do I actually implement this?"

Start here:

1. **Pick ONE gate.** Not all at once. Start with: "all code must pass tests"

2. **Integrate it.** Add to your CI/CD. Gate agent outputs.

3. **Measure.** Track how many submissions fail.

4. **Iterate.** Ask: Why did they fail? How do I improve the gate?

5. **Add next gate.** Once you're comfortable, add gate #2.

In 4-6 weeks, you'll have a robust system.

Want step-by-step guidance? [BOOK A CALL] and we'll design the system for your specific needs.
