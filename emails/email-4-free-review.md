# Email 4: Free Architecture Review Offer

**Subject:** Free architecture review (5 spots left this week)

---

Hi {First_Name},

Final email from me (then I'll stop).

**If your AI system has any of these problems:**

- Hallucinations in production
- Latency >2 seconds
- Cost spiraling
- Not confident it's production-ready

**Let's fix it.**

**I'm offering:** Free 30-minute architecture review

**What we'll do:**
1. Review your current architecture
2. Identify top 3 gaps/risks
3. Give you specific recommendations

**No sales pitch. Just engineering feedback.**

**Book here: [Link]**

I only do 5 of these per week. Grab a slot if you want one.

P.S. If you don't book, that's fine. I'll still send occasional AI architecture insights. Just no more "book a call" emails. Deal?
