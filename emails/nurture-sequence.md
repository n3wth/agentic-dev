# Email Sequence: Agentic Dev (5-Email Nurture)

## Email 1: Welcome + Value Prop

**Subject:** Your first autonomous agent—starting guide included

Hi [Name],

Welcome to the Agentic Dev mailing list.

You signed up because you're curious about building autonomous agents. Or maybe you have a specific problem you think an agent could solve.

Either way, you're in good company. 100+ companies are already running agents in production. The results are dramatic:
- Support teams handling 80% of tickets autonomously
- Hiring agents screening 500+ resumes/week
- Sales agents qualifying leads 10x faster

But most companies get stuck on the same question: "How do we actually build this?"

Over the next week, I'm sharing:
- Why autonomous agents work (and when they don't)
- Real case studies with numbers
- A step-by-step deployment guide
- The tech stack and architecture patterns top companies use

This isn't theory. It's battle-tested patterns from companies that are live in production.

Let's start with a question: **What problem would you solve with an agent if you could?**

Reply to this email. I read every response and it helps me send you more relevant content.

P.S. If you work at a SaaS company with $5M+ ARR, we should probably talk about building your first agent. [Schedule a call](#)

## Email 2: Case Study / Social Proof

**Subject:** How this company cut support response time from 8 hours to 1 minute

Hi [Name],

Quick case study.

SupportFlow is a customer support software company. They had 2,000 support tickets/week and a team of 12 drowning.

The problem: Response time was 8 hours. Customers hated it. Team was burned out.

We helped them build an autonomous support agent.

The agent:
- Handles password resets (40% of volume)
- Answers billing questions (18% of volume)
- Processes refunds (15% of volume)
- Escalates complex issues to humans

Results:
- 80% of tickets resolved autonomously
- Response time: 8 hours -> 1 minute
- Support team freed up to handle complex issues
- Cost per ticket: $45 -> $3

And here's the kicker: They started offering this agent as a product feature. Landed 3 enterprise customers ($1.5M ARR) specifically for it.

The pattern: When you automate routine work, your team gets happier AND your business scales.

## Email 3: How-To / Educational Content

**Subject:** The agent architecture pattern we use for every deployment

Hi [Name],

You want to build an agent. Where do you start?

Most teams jump straight to coding. Big mistake.

The smart teams start with architecture.

Here's the pattern we use for every agent deployment:

**Step 1: Define the problem clearly**
- What specific task? (not "improve customer service," but "screen support tickets")
- How much volume? (500/week? 5,000/week?)
- What's the cost today? ($45/ticket? $200/decision?)

**Step 2: Choose the right architecture**
- Single agent (simple, handles one task)
- Multi-agent (complex workflows, multiple specialized agents)
- Hierarchical (approval workflows, escalation)

**Step 3: Define agent scope**
- What can the agent do? (read data, send emails, modify records)
- What can't the agent do? (delete data, approve large transactions)
- What requires human approval? (escalation rules)

**Step 4: Build guardrails**
- What prevents the agent from going off the rails?
- What metrics trigger alerts?
- What's the audit trail?

**Step 5: Test and deploy phased**
- Week 1: Shadow mode (agent recommends, human approves)
- Week 2-3: Limited scope (agent handles 25% autonomously)
- Week 4-5: Expanded scope (agent handles 60%)
- Week 6+: Full production (agent handles 100%, humans monitor)

We put together a checklist you can use to plan your agent: [Download the architecture checklist](#)

Use it this week. The clarity it creates is worth the 30 minutes.

## Email 4: Limited Offer / Scarcity

**Subject:** We're launching agent building consulting (limited spots)

Hi [Name],

We're launching consulting to help companies build their first autonomous agents.

This isn't a course or template. It's hands-on work:
- Week 1: Assess your opportunity (which processes can be automated?)
- Week 2-3: Design agent architecture
- Week 4-6: Build and deploy (with guardrails, monitoring, everything)
- Week 7+: Optimize based on real-world results

Standard investment: $150K-$250K depending on complexity.

For early supporters (this month only), we're offering **40% off**. Brings cost to $90K-$150K.

This covers:
- Full agent design and architecture
- Implementation and deployment
- Guardrails and safety setup
- Monitoring and optimization
- 3 months of ongoing support

**Why the discount?** We want case studies. If we help you build a successful agent, you become a reference customer. That's worth the discount to us.

Spots are limited (5 companies total).

If you're at a SaaS company with clear agent opportunities, this might be worth a conversation.

[Schedule a 30-minute consultation](#) - no obligation.

We'll discuss:
- Your process and pain points
- Whether an agent could help
- What success would look like
- Whether consulting makes sense for you

Even if consulting isn't right, you'll walk away with clarity on your agent opportunity.

## Email 5: Final CTA + Guarantee

**Subject:** Last chance: 40% off agent consulting (only this month)

Hi [Name],

This is the last email in the sequence.

If you've made it this far, something resonated:
- The support agent case study (80% autonomous)
- The hiring agent case study (14-day hiring cycle)
- The architecture pattern we shared

Here's what's true: Autonomous agents are real, they work, and most companies aren't using them yet.

The companies that build them first will have a massive advantage. 24/7 customer support that never sleeps. Hiring that scales infinitely. Sales teams that qualify 10x more leads.

We want to help you get there.

**40% off consulting expires on [DATE].**

If you're serious about building your first agent, [let's talk](#).

30-minute call. We'll tell you honestly if it makes sense. No sales pitch.

Here's what we guarantee:
- Clear assessment of your agent opportunity
- Honest recommendation (sometimes agents aren't the right answer)
- If we work together, we ship results (not reports)

What's the worst that happens? You get 30 minutes of clarity on a strategic decision.

What's the best? You deploy an agent that saves your company $2-5M/year.

Worth a call, [Name]?
