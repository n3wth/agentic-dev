# Email 1: Welcome + Checklist Delivery

**Subject:** Your AI Architecture Checklist (+ the #1 mistake I see)

---

Hi {First_Name},

Your AI Agent Architecture Checklist is ready.

Quick intro: I build production AI systems. Not demos. Not prototypes. **Systems that run 24/7 handling millions of requests.**

Here's what I've learned: **Most AI systems aren't production-ready.**

They work in demos. They fail in prod.

**The checklist you downloaded will tell you if yours is ready.**

**How to use it:**

1. Score each section honestly
2. If you're <85, you have work to do
3. If you're <60, do NOT deploy yet

**After you score yourself, reply with your number.**

I'll send specific recommendations for your situation.
