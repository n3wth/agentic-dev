- Size (# members)
- Activity level (messages/day)
- Join method (open/invite/paid)
- Relevant channels (#help, #jobs, #showcase)
- Quality score (1-10)

### 2. Engagement Strategy
For each high-quality community:
- What value can Oliver provide?
- What questions are people asking?
- Where can he showcase expertise?
- What's the vibe? (technical/casual/promotional-ok)

### 3. Draft Messages
Create 10 example messages for different scenarios:
- Answering technical questions
- Sharing orchestrator insights
- Offering help (not selling)
- Showcasing work (when appropriate)
